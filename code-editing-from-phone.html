<h1 class="title">Code editing from phone</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Mobile phones are not really ideal devices to edit code and do serious programming. Although I still wanted to have a solution to let me edit scripts, push to git, save on home server or just run modified scripts. 
</p>

<p>
There might be some good editors that works with webdav or sftp server. But I couldn't find any good ones for ios. My solution, run a code server and access it from anywhere with VPN. <a href="http://linuxserver.io">linuxserver.io</a> has a nice docker image for this. It runs a selfhosted version of <a href="https://vscode.dev">https://vscode.dev</a>. 
</p>

<p>
My main usecase is to write blogs/static web pages like this one in org mode. Which will be published on github pages. I will try to write my thoughts, informative notes as blogs, or any random things I wish to.

Let's see how long before I abandon this project. üëª
