Mobile phones are not really ideal devices to edit code and do serious programming. Although I still wanted to have a solution to let me edit scripts, push to git, save on home server or just run modified scripts. 

There might be some good editors that works with webdav or sftp server. But I couldn't find any good ones for ios. My solution, run a code server and access it from anywhere with VPN. [[http://linuxserver.io][linuxserver.io]] has a nice docker image for this. It runs a selfhosted version of [[https://vscode.dev]]. 

My main usecase is to write blogs/static web pages like this one in org mode. Which will be published on github pages. I will try to write my thoughts, informative notes as blogs, or any random things I wish to. 

Let's see how long before I abandon this project. ðŸ‘»
